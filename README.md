# Can You Survive

Can you survive? is a top down, tile-based survival game, that shows the struggle of a polar bear trying to survive in their own home while facing the consequences of climate change.

## Description

Experience the struggles of melting glaciers while trying to survive the winter hibernation by getting as much food as you can in a world that keeps melting all around you and makes everything more challenging year by year.
